# Crowd_funding_ETL
project2

Collaborators : Nasir Qadri and Mehr Atif

For the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) mini project, we have worked with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and  Python dictionary methods  to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we  created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
